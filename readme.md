# Open Source AI Code Interpreter

The easiest way to get started is to fork this repl.
In the Shell, do pip install streamlit.
Then hit run.
You may also need to install the openai package.
Then, in Secrets, add your OpenAI API key.

You can also run the code locally. It's a Streamlit app so just run streamlit main.py and download necessary packages with pip.
Set your OpenAI API key as a local variable.
